# Project Planner Updates

## Page Structure Changes

The application has been restructured to have a more intuitive page flow:

### Primary Pages

1. **Dashboard**
   - Create and manage project plans
   - Overview of all projects with status information
   - Access to create new projects or edit existing ones

2. **Project Details**
   - Enter basic project information:
     - Project name
     - Dates
     - Client review timeframes
     - Budget selection
   - This page uses the `ActivitySelection` component but focuses on initial project setup

3. **Activities & Timeline**
   - Combined view of the project timeline and activities
   - Three view modes:
     - Calendar view
     - Gantt chart view
     - List view
   - Collapsible stages and activities organized by project stages
   - Ability to update activity status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Delayed)

### Secondary Pages

- **Client View** - Shareable view for clients to see project progress
- **Admin Dashboard** - Administrative tools and settings
- **User Profile** - User account management

## New Components

### `ActivitiesTimelineView`

The centerpiece of the new structure is the `ActivitiesTimelineView` component, which merges:
- Calendar/Gantt visualization 
- Activity management
- Status updates

This component displays:
1. Project overview header with key metrics
2. View mode selection (Calendar, Gantt, List)
3. Visual timeline representation
4. Collapsible stages with activities

### `StageActivityList`

A new component that:
- Groups activities by their project stages
- Provides collapsible sections for each stage
- Shows stage completion progress
- Allows activity status updates
- Displays detailed activity information

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Simplified Navigation** - Users no longer have to switch between separate pages for timeline and activity management
2. **Improved Context** - Activity updates are made with the timeline visible, providing better context
3. **Logical Organization** - Activities are grouped by project stages, showing a clear project progression
4. **Easier Status Management** - Quick status updates from a context menu make project management more efficient
5. **Consistent Experience** - The unified interface provides a more coherent user experience

## Technical Changes

1. Merged `TimelineDisplay` and `ActivitySelection` functionality
2. Added stage-based organization of activities
3. Created collapsible UI elements for better space management
4. Simplified the stepper to a two-step process
5. Enhanced activity status updates with visual indicators

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to consider:

1. Stage-level status updates
2. Drag-and-drop activity reordering within stages
3. Bulk status updates for multiple activities
4. Timeline filtering by stage
5. Stage-specific timeline views
